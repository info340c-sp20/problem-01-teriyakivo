    <h1>Zuko</h1>

     alt="Zuko holding flame. Season 3, Episode 13: The Firebending Masters">
    <p>Zuko is a fire bending master from the show <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">
        Avatar: the Last Airbender</a></cite> . He is son to Firelord Ozai, brother to Princess Azula and nephew to General
        Iroh. Zuko is arguably the most dynamic character in the series. He transforms from an angsty teenage boy looking to
        redeem his honor to a compassionate, righteous mentor to the person who he was formerly seeking to capture.</p>
    <p>Reasons why I admire Zuko:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="red">He fights for his honor.</li>
        <li>He has a cool scar on his face.</li>
        <li>His uncle Iroh is OP.</li>
    </ul>
